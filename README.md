The Plant Monitoring System tracks temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. Displays real-time data on a web server and TFT display. Sends email alerts on low moisture levels. The web interface also logs the last 10 sensor readings, includes a progress bar for moisture levels, and allows users to download logs as a text file.
